## Why did you write this?

After running through the boiler plate of starting express, http, https, and socket.io servers, I decided that there had to be a simpler way to combine all of these technologies together.  So I set off to write a simple micro-framework to handle basic integration in an elegant, high performance manner.

## Do all of the examples work?

YES!  I went through and painstakingly tested all of the examples.  I noticed that there are tons of example snippets of express and socket.io, that are missing lines of code, or are just plain wrong. 

Hopefully, this boat load of examples will help.

## Is Express.io ready for production?

YES! Use it in production.  We have been using it in production without issue.  It is built on express and socket.io which are both very solid.

## Why coffeescript?

If it wasn't for coffeescript, I would not be coding in node.  Period.  All of the examples in the documentation are written in what I call "lazy javascript".  It's javascript that is not the best from a coding perspective, (I don't use `var` etc.).  The point is to be as simple and concise as possible, yet still produce workable code.

Give your curly brace turd language a rest, and put your big boy pants on. :)
