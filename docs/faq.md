### Why did you write this?

After running through the agony of starting express, http, https, and socket.io servers from scratch a few dozen times, I decided that there had to be a better way to combine all of these technologies together in a non-stupid manner.  

So, I set off to write a simple micro-framework to put everything together into one elegant and high performance library.

__Express.io__ is also a "response" to all of the other "realtime" frameworks out there that tend to:

* Not be ready for production.
* Try to deliver everything, including the kitchen sink.
* Have poorly written examples, that often times don't work.
* Have serious architectural issues baked right into them.
* Have small user bases that make them a bad choice to get help with.
* Have so many decisions made for you, that you feel like you are working with Rails (and yes that's a bad thing, go fuck yourself DHH!)

### Do all of the examples work?

YES! I went through and painstakingly tested all of the examples.  Almost all of them can be copy-pasted directly from the docs.

### Is Express.io a drop-in replacement for express?

YES!  Just replace express with express.io, and you should have no issues with your current app.

### Is Express.io ready for production?

YES! We have been using it in production without issue.

### What is a "contrib shout out"?

Basically, if you fork the project, and add your github handle and a short message to the `CONTRIB` file, then I will merge your pull request.

This is so that you can brag to all of your friends that you're a contributor of __express.io__. :)

Some might call this stupid or gimmicky.  Well, put your pithy gripe in a pull request, and it will go up there for everyone to see how clever you are.
