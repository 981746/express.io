## Why did you write this?

After running through the boiler plate of starting express, http, https, and socket.io servers, I decided that there had to be a simpler way to use all of these technologies together.  Hence express.io was born.

I also believe that there has to be a simpler combination of these two technologies than a monolithic framework that tries to do everything for you.

Express.io is a super set of of express and socket.io.  You get all the convenience, and you don't have to sacrifice any of the flexibility of these two great platforms.

## Do all of the examples work?

YES!  I went through and painstakingly tested all of the examples.  I noticed that there are tons of example snippets of express and socket.io, that are missing lines of code, or are just plain wrong. 


## Why coffeescript?

If it wasn't for coffeescript, I would not be coding in node.js.  Period.  All of the examples in the documentation are written in what I call "lazy javascript".  It's javascript that is not the best from a coding perspective, (I don't use `var` etc.).  The point is to be as simple and concise from an example perspective, yet still produce workable code.

Give your curly brace turd language a rest, and put your big boy pants on. :)
